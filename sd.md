###### A Sequence diagram is an interaction diagram that shows how objects operate with one another and in what order. It shows object interactions arranged in time sequence. It depicts the objects and classes involved in the scenario and the sequence of messages exchanged between the objects needed to carry out the functionality of the scenario.

###### In a sequence diagram, parallel vertical lines are the lifelines, different processes or objects that live simultaneously. And the horizontal arrows are the messages exchanged between them, in the order in which they occur. This allows the specification of simple runtime scenarios in a graphical manner.
